What is STEM?
STEM stands for "Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics" and forms the foundation for a universal set of skills that are essential to thrive in the near future.  
â€‹STEM education exposes students to interdisciplinary projects where they:

<p>1) Apply concepts of science, mathematics, engineering and technology/programming to solve problems
</p>
<p>2) Engage in higher order thinking skills such as analysis, evaluation, and synthesis 
</p>
<p>3) Follow a design process to create digital and physical prototypes in a collaborative manner
</p> 
<p>Why is it important for girls to participate in STEM?</p>
STEM fields are highly sought after these days. The demand will continue to grow in the future. These fields pay higher wages
and are cognitively stimulating. However, girls are hugely underrepresented in these fields. They are missing out on all the 
wonderful opportunities. With timely intervention, engaging program and motivating environment, we can change that.
